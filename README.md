### Installation
```bash
composer require singlequote/laravel-cacher
```

## Usage

### Model Caching
Sometimes you just want to cache the model results. With model caching you can without making a mess in your code. Include the `cacher` trait within your model.
```php
namespace App;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable; //<= basic shizzle
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail; //<= basic shizzle

use SingleQuote\Cacher\Traits\Cacher; //⇐ this one

class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail
{
    use Cacher; //<=  require the model to use the trait
}
```

Now whenever you call your `App\User` model, you can use the caching trait

```php
use App\User;

$users = User::whereEmail('foo@bar.world')->remember(); //<= default ttl is 7 days
$users = User::whereEmail('foo@bar.world')->remember(3600); //<= 1 hour

//or keep it forever by your side <3
$users = User::whereEmail('foo@bar.world')->rememberForever();
```
